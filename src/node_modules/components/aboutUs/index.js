        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
        Since ancient times, man has sought to cover his naked body, which could be explained by chastity and a sense of shame. However, such an interpretation seems too narrow and limited, because there are tribes that did and do without clothes (for example, the aborigines of Australia, etc.).</p>
